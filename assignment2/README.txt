2. This project was fairly straightforward, although I did see two design decisions:
	- Because I didn't use the stanford library, I had to write my own point struct. This was annoying, mostly because I didn't get access to any helper methods. I think how I handled point manipulation in the step() method is cool though: you should check it out.
	- Instead of manually stepping through each adjacent point, I used sine and cosine to loop through the potential points. It's pretty elegant.

3. I disliked the amount of pre-written code: I think it takes away from the overall understanding of the assignment, although I understand why we are provided starter code.

4. I spent 2-3 hours on this assignment.

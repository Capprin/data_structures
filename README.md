# data_structures
Contains all the code I wrote during my college data structures course

A few notes:
- Many of these projects contain "wrapper" code provided by my professors. These files will have their names as the headings.
- My code files are titled with my own heading.
- Each of these projects uses one data structure or another, with more complex data structures later on
- Assignments one and five are missing; Assignment one was a placeholder, and assignment 5 was too broken for me to have any desire to upload it.
- Personally, I think assignment4 (markov) has the coolest implementation of data structures
